Jython works, although a number of changes were required to make it
work, and some limitations still exist.

* Jython 2.5 has the old Python 2.5 syntax for try/except handling, so
  is not supported. Jython 2.7 is still in beta, but seems to work
  fine.

* Jython does not have the __builtins__ symbol, so the __builtin__
  module has to be imported. Sadly Python 3 does not have the
  __builtin__ module, so a bit of a hack is required to get this to
  work.

* Jython does not support the multiprocessing module. The claim is
  that since Jython uses Java for multitasking - and therefore has no
  GIL - multiprocessing is not necessary. It was easy to add thread
  support back in, since the APIs are almost identical. A limitation is 
  that the number of cores cannot be returned programatically any more.

* A few minor differences, such as not having the O_NOATIME symbol or
  supporting fcntl().

* Performance is pretty darn slow. I can't imagine using the Jython
  version unless for some reason a Java interpreter was available but
  it was impossible to install CPython.
